Branch C: Statistical Features MLP

WHAT THIS DOES:
  Extracts classical statistical features from an image and uses an MLP
  (Multi-Layer Perceptron) to detect statistical anomalies caused by
  steganography.

  Feature pipeline:
    Input Image → Handcrafted Statistical Features → MLP → Feature Vector

FEATURES EXTRACTED:
  1. Pixel histogram: How are pixel values distributed? (256 bins)
  2. Chi-square statistic: Are pairs of adjacent histogram bins unusually equal?
     In a natural image, adjacent even/odd histogram bins are NOT equally populated
     — they follow the natural image distribution.
     After LSB embedding with random data, each pixel's LSB is overwritten with a
     random bit, which tends to EQUALISE adjacent even/odd bin pairs:
       e.g. bin[200] and bin[201] become nearly equal after embedding.
     The RS chi-square statistic measures this equalization:
       - For natural images: chi-square is HIGHER (bins are unequal)
       - For stego images:   chi-square is LOWER  (bins are equalized)
     The model learns this pattern either way; we must report the direction correctly.
  3. Entropy: How random is the pixel distribution?
  4. Mean, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis: Basic statistics
  5. Local variance: How does pixel variance vary across the image?

WHY THIS CATCHES STEGANOGRAPHY:
  When you embed data via LSB with a random payload, each pixel's last bit
  is set to a random 0 or 1.  This forces each pair of adjacent histogram
  bins (e.g. bins for value 200 and 201) towards equal counts.
  Natural images do NOT have equal adjacent bins — the distribution is smooth
  but not symmetric at the 1-bit level.

  The chi-square test quantifies how close each pair is to equal counts.
  LOWER chi-square → more equalized → more suspicious of LSB embedding.
  HIGHER chi-square → more unequal → more natural (likely clean).

  The CNN learns this relationship automatically from data; the feature
  value itself (whether low or high chi-sq = stego) is empirically determined
  during training. What matters is that the feature changes measurably.

NOTE ON HONESTY (from project docs):
  Branch C works well against classical/older steganography.
  It is NOT reliable against modern adaptive steganography.
  In your report: say Branch C targets "classical statistical anomalies."
  Don't claim it catches GAN-based stego.

TARGET: Be honest. Branch C adds value as a third perspective; Branches
        A and B carry the main classification load.

BOTH STUDENTS TASK: Build this together in Week 7.

def compute_chi_square_statistic(img: np.ndarray) -> float:
    """
    RS Chi-square test for detecting LSB steganography.

    THE CORRECT THEORY:
      In a natural image, adjacent histogram bins (e.g. 200 and 201) have
      counts that follow the underlying image distribution — they are
      generally NOT equal to each other.

      After LSB embedding with a RANDOM payload, each pixel's LSB is
      overwritten with a random bit (0 or 1 with equal probability 0.5).
      This tends to EQUALISE adjacent even/odd bin pairs:
        pixels with value 200 → some become 201, pixels with value 201 →
        some become 200, until both bins tend toward (count_200 + count_201) / 2.

      The chi-square statistic measures the DEVIATION from equal bin pairs:
        chi_sq = sum( (observed - expected)^2 / expected )
        where expected = (bin[2k] + bin[2k+1]) / 2  for k = 0..127

      DIRECTION (important for correct theory):
        - Natural (clean) image:  chi_sq is HIGH   (bins are unequal, natural)
        - After LSB embedding:    chi_sq is LOW     (bins are equalized)

      A LOWER chi-square therefore indicates HIGHER suspicion of stego.
      The model learns this from data; the feature sign just must be consistent.

        Chi-square statistic (float). LOWER = more suspicious for LSB stego.
